public static void WelcomeMessage (String message, String caption, String author)
This method should display a MessageBox (using MessageBox.Show (…)) to display the
message parameter with a caption from the caption parameter.  The author and caption may have default
values if you wish. public static void GoodbyeMessage (String message) Similar to WelcomeMessage above, this should 
display a MessageBox with an appropriate goodbye message.  You may add other parameters such as a date or
time or an author’s name if needed. public static void Setup() This method contains code that initializes 
the console features such as background and foreground colors, the console caption, clears the console, 
and takes any other steps that you might want to take to set up your console for a new console application.  
Optionally, if you think it appropriate, it might also use your WelcomeMessage method above to display a welcome message.
private static string CleanString (ref string work) This method takes an input string parameter
(named work here), and it performs two types of cleanup operations on the string before returning 
the resulting string.  Use appropriate methods from the String class.
